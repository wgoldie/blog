    "That’s a bit of a platitude. There are plenty of bugs one could encounter in ML code: misaligned tensors, floating point error explosion, improper dataset segmentation… the list goes on. None of these seem to be a uniquely difficult class of bug - harder to find and fix than those we might find in a program like a webserver or syntax parser. Even the tricky problems around parallel processing or offloading computation to GPUs aren’t much harder than what you can find with device drivers and multithreading elsewhere. There is the argument that ML has some very difficult algorithms to understand correctly, but I’ll throw that in a bin labeled “Computer Science” and ignore it for this analysis. So what is my assertion about - giving me the benefit of the doubt here, and assuming that I actually have something worthwhile to say?"

And in fact, the failure modes for these problems are pretty good, in the sense that they help us fix the bugs. When a tensor is misaligned, we get an exception and the program stops. We can debug the cause and fix it. When the GPU starts filling up, we can analyze how much data we’re putting on it, and try to lower our batch size or unrolled model size.

Statistical bias is harder - in some cases, we can examine, manually or statistically, the outputs of our models for characteristic bias. In other cases, the possibility of indiscernible bias is arguably a fundamental limitation for the appropriate applications of machine learning. However, I’m also going to throw this problem, for the course of this article, in the bucket labeled “~~Computer Science~~Computer Science and Statistics.” These aren’t coding problems, and not what I’m trying to assert something about right now [[1]](#[1]).

The first is the nature of gradient-based optimization, which is the dominant paradigm for ML model training (proponents of GA and similar techniques not withstanding). We can formalize a gradient-descended model as a tuple  $<W, L, G>$  (weights $W$, loss function $L:W \\to Z$, gradient function $G:Z \\to  L$). If everything is specified and implemented correctly, then we expect that $L(W) < L(W+\\lambda (G(L(W)))$, for $\\lambda$ very small. This is simply the definition of the gradient. "

This is the concept behind stochastic gradient descent, of course: approximate the true gradient with a minibatch gradient, and descend as if it was the real one. Here, we actually have a different tuple: $<W, L’, G>$. $L’$ is the loss function taken over the batch, not the sample population. The gradient, presumably, is correct, but taken over the wrong points. We can recover the second tuple $<W, L, G’>$ by defining $G’ = G(L’(W))$ - now we approximate the true loss with a different gradient, which we assert is correlated with the true gradient.
